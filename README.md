<b>Submission for Electrothon Hackathon 2021.</b>

<h2>About:</h2>

Green Route is an App that works on the mechanism of signalling all Google Map users on the shortest route in a 1 Km radius of an Ambulance approach and partnerning with the Traffic Control to alter traffic restrictions in that route to create a temporary <b>Green Corridor</b> making an emergency reponse lightning.

<h2>Problem it solves:</h2>

According to the World Economic Forum, 150,000 people die each day in India. A Recent Study has showed that around 86,000 people die due to untimely healthcare which accounts for 57% of the deaths. One of the prime causes for this  baneful situation is the traffic. For a country like India, where the population is humungous, commute is a major hassle. Emergency responses are slowed down in traffic and several lives are lost due to this untimely response.

Our product puts Google maps in a never-used-before manner through our ambulance guidance and vehicle signalling system. The Partnership and Integration with the Traffic Control System enables a local green corridor that allows critical services to reach the site of required response in good time. 

We also partner with Google Ventures and Google Capital to access their data base and reach as an extended plugin to the maps.

### Features:
  * [x] Green Route is App that allows speedy route for Ambulance.
  * [x] It has a User Authentication using ID Card that verifies user using OCR & Firebase ML Vison so that only Medical Professionals get access to Green Corridor addition features.
  * [x] Route from Source to Destination is shown using Polylines.
  * [x] Sends personalized sound Notification to users saying "Ambulance is on the way" as drivers can check phone during driving.
  * [x] Can be used on both iOS & Android.
